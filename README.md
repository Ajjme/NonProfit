The Rmd files are the main reports 
if there is just one graphic we will use RDS to store it. As of now the only way to get shiny object to show up is to embed all the code which is fine.

Each script is built in 5 segments input zoning/cleaning, standardizing and graphing.

010 scripts are EV
020 are MCE
030 is civic spark
040 is electrification
050 is solar and storage
060 is home heating
070 is electricians

09_info are just cool charts I think fit in each report. Number convention should follow there too.

Sources should be copied to the top of every script and pulled through to each report

map style is white with the Cities shape file in grey

Bar charts are all white background single horizantal lines across 
Black outlines
