Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing the transportation industry by offering an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. As EVs become more mainstream, understanding the trends and challenges of EV adoption and charging infrastructure is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and EV enthusiasts alike. In this report, we present a comprehensive analysis of new EV sales in California by city and county(with a particular focus on Contra Costa County), featuring interactive graphs that show new EV sales data standardized by the number of cars in those respective cities and counties. We also provide detailed information on EV chargers in each city, including a map of public charger locations, and highlight the federal electric bus program, which is driving the transition to zero-emission buses. All of the data used in this report is sourced from publicly available datasets, ensuring transparency and accountability. Whether you are a policy maker looking to advance sustainable transportation policies, a researcher seeking to understand the latest trends in EV adoption, or an EV enthusiast wanting to stay informed about charging infrastructure, this report is an essential read. Join us on this journey as we explore the latest developments in the EV landscape and the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

In addition to new EV sales and charging infrastructure data, this report also includes graphs on key factors related to the EV landscape. This includes the average cost of ownership, battery material sourcing, car fires, and well-to-wheel emissions. By providing a comprehensive analysis of these factors, the report offers a holistic view of the EV landscape in California and empowers readers to make informed decisions about the future of sustainable transportation.

The California Energy Commission (CEC) has launched the School Bus Replacement Program, which aims to replace California's oldest diesel buses with all-new battery electric buses and install supporting charging infrastructure. 
In addition to the School Bus Replacement Program, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) provides funding for electric school buses and supports the transition to a zero-emission school bus fleet. Data on those recipients has not been included in this report. If you know how/where to get that information please reach out.
