# **Introduction**
Fellowship and job training programs play a vital role in equipping the next generation with the knowledge, skills, and passion necessary to address the pressing environmental challenges we face. By providing students with a comprehensive understanding of sustainability principles, they can develop innovative solutions to reduce waste, conserve resources, promote renewable energy, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Through experiential learning, these fellows can gain practical experience and collaborate with experts in various sustainability fields, fostering their critical thinking abilities and nurturing a deep sense of responsibility towards the environment. 
By investing in the education and training of students through this initiative, we lay the foundation for a sustainable future that values the well-being of both people and the planet.

All data used is sourced from publicly available data sets, ensuring transparency and accountability.

# **Scores**

## Civic Spark and Climate Action Fellows Scores

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}


plotly_obj_scores_employ <- readRDS(file = "./plotly_obj_scores_employ.rds")
plotly_obj_scores_employ
```
Rankings are the culmination of two factors:
- If they currently have a fellow (50) and if they have had fellows in the past (50)
There are many other fellowship programs for sustainability jobs. If your city is involved in one please reach out to us with the data.

## Civic Spark

CivicSpark's mission is to contribute to a vision of addressing entrenched and emerging issues by building local public sector capacity, serving as a social purpose career accelerator, and fostering authentic community engagement. As an AmeriCorps program, CivicSpark focuses on building capacity for local public agencies to tackle community resilience issues like climate change, water resource management, housing, and mobility. CivicSpark recruits Fellows each year to implement sustainability and resilience projects while building long-term capacity, providing dedicated project support and professional development to local public agencies and fostering stronger partnerships for increased community resilience.

The California Climate Action Corps, led by California Volunteers, Office of the Governor, and implemented by Bay Area Community Resources, is a national service program that offers a Fellowship for emerging climate and civic leaders, driven by hope for a better future. Fellows join the program for a paid term of service, partnering with public agencies, tribes, nonprofits, and educational institutions to address climate change in frontline communities heavily impacted by its effects. Through their service, Fellows lead and support projects focusing on urban greening, organic waste and edible food recovery, and wildfire resiliency.

Electricians are essential for sustainability and the energy transition as they not only install renewable energy systems but also upgrade homes by integrating energy-saving devices, such as LED lighting and smart thermostats. Through their expertise, electricians enable homeowners to reduce their carbon footprint, promote energy efficiency, and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.


## Gender Disparity in the Contra Costa County Electrician Workforce

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pi <- readRDS(file = "./map_Electricians_pie.rds")

```
Having women in the electrician workforce would create added value through their diverse perspectives, unique skill sets, and innovative problem-solving approaches. Their presence would foster a more inclusive and supportive work environment, promoting teamwork, collaboration, and overall productivity. By encouraging and empowering women to join the industry, we can unlock untapped potential, leading to a more balanced and thriving electrician workforce.
