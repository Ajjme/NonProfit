# **Introduction**
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing transportation as a fossil free environmental alternative to traditional gas-powered vehicles. Understanding the trends and challenges of EV adoption and charging infrastructure is crucial for local policymakers.  This report provides:

- A comprehensive analysis of EV sales by city and county (focusing on Contra Costa County), featuring interactive graphs standardized by the total number of cars in each respective city and county 

- Detailed information on EVs and EV chargers in each city, including a map of public charger locations, a chart of most the popular models, and highlight the federal electric bus program, which is driving the transition to zero-emission buses. 

- Graphs on key factors related to the EV landscape are also included: the average cost of ownership, car fires, and well-to-wheel emissions. These factors, offer a holistic view of the EV landscape in California and empowers readers to make informed decisions about the future of sustainable transportation.
    
All data used is sourced from publicly available data sets, ensuring transparency and accountability. 

# **City Electric Transportation Rankings**

Electric vehicle (EV) charging is important because it enables the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation system, reducing the carbon footprint and air pollution caused by traditional vehicles. The availability of a robust and reliable charging infrastructure is crucial to encourage the adoption of EVs and to provide drivers with the confidence to travel longer distances. Additionally, EV charging offers economic benefits by reducing fuel costs and providing new business opportunities in the energy sector.

## ZEV sales by Model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
scat_zev <- readRDS( file = "scat_zev.rds")
scat_zev
```
Zero Emission Vehicles or ZEV Encompasses Electric Vehicles, Hydrogen Vehicles and Plug in Hybrid Vehicles. 
The main report focuses on Just EVs because, Hydrogen and PHEV vehicles are less efficient than true electric vehicles. They have lower energy efficiency due to the support of an internal combustion engine in PHEVs or the inefficiency of producing and delivering hydrogen in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The infrastructure for charging electric vehicles is more developed than that for refueling hydrogen vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are more expensive to produce than BEVs and PHEVs tend to be more expensive than BEVs. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and PHEVs still produce emissions, while BEVs are considered to be more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.
Other ZEVs were in the data set but we are only displaying the top 5 brands to simplify the graph.

# **Reasons to Transition to an Electric Vehicle**

## Average Cost of Ownership
```{r, , echo=FALSE}
line <- readRDS(file = "./line_graph.rds")
line
```
Calculations are using the least expensive Internal combustion F150 (Rear wheel drive) compared to the standard F150 Lightining with current tax credits. Standard 15,000 mile yearly range and Current PG&E kWh pricing and local gas price of $4.00 applied. Insurance, depreciation and a multitude of other factors were taken from national averages. Cost of ownership drops in year 7 due to salvage value. If you want to play around with the parameters use this tool:

## Car Fires
```{r, , echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'left', fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
fig_car_fire <- readRDS(file = "fig_car_fire.rds")
fig_car_fire
```
Electric vehicles (EVs) have a lower risk of fires than internal combustion vehicles (ICVs) because they do not have a fuel system that can ignite. However, when an EV does catch fire, it can be more difficult to extinguish due to the high-voltage battery and the potential for reignition. ICVs are more likely to catch fire due to fuel leaks or electrical malfunctions, but these fires are typically easier to control and extinguish. 

Ford and GM have both had recent recalls on their electric vehicles due to thermal runaway. However EVs remain far less likely to catch fire then their Internal Combustion counter parts.
The data shown here is from the Bureau of Transportation crash report(2017).

# **Statewide Adoption Levels**
